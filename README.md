# LeetCode-Java-Kotlin

This project contains solution for LeetCode problems. 

Every solution is given in both Java and Kotlin language

As the size of the LeetCode problems keep growing, this project will be updated regularly, contributions in any form will be much appreciated.

Trying to help more folks, I will try to add LeetCode link and solution's space and time complexity to every problem.

In the near future, I am considering add Golang solution as well.
